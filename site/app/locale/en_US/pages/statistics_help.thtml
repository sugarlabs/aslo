<p>The Statistics Dashboard displays download and update ping data collected for your add-on.</p>
<h4>Downloads</h4>
<p>Download counts are updated every day and only include original add-on downloads, not updates.</p>

<h4>Update Pings</h4>
<p>Add-ons downloaded from this site check for updates once per day, and the total number of these update pings is known as Active Daily Users. Active Daily Users (ADU) can be broken down by add-on version, operating system, add-on status, and application.</p>
